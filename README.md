# Primitive Progress

Primitive Progress is a Minecraft mod that overhauls the early- to mid-game crafting experience by introducing a wide range of interactive, survival-oriented workstations with a more primitive feel. Instead of relying on instant crafting grids or high-tech automation, this mod emphasizes manual effort, timing, and engagement in more immersive survival progression.

## Cooking Pot

        The cooking pot is used to cook different kinds of foods with the risk of making failed or burnt dishes if one isn't careful. 
        All recipes are shapeless and players can either throw the ingredients into the pot or open it by interacting with it.

        Pottery wheels are used to shape clay into items such as bowls, vases, molds or sculptures that can be fired into ceramic form. 
        Players must first interact with the pottery wheel gui to choose what item they want to craft from a list of possible recipes.
        To start crafting, the pottery wheel must be kept spinning while players add clay lumps onto the wheel until the crafting is finished. 
        If the spinning stops, the craft fails.
        The advanced pottery wheel allows for more complex recipes and is easier to keep spinning.

        Clay effigies are magical constructus that can be crafted at pottery wheels. 
        They can be used to spawn villagers or allow for player respawns as a replacement for beds.
