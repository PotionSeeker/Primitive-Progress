Peasantry Progress is a Minecraft mod that overhauls the early- to mid-game crafting experience by introducing a wide range of interactive, low-tech workstations. Instead of relying on instant crafting grids or industrial automation, there is an emphasizes on manual effort and engagement in more immersive survival progression.

# Features

## Cooking Pot and Stove
<img width="648" height="396" alt="primitive_pot_screenshot_1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e86e60a-e494-4058-84b6-eb0a8d595bc0" />

        The cooking pot is used to prepare different kinds of dishes with the risk of making dubious food or burnt food if one isn't careful. 
        All recipes are shapeless and players can either throw the ingredients into the pot or open it's gui by interacting with it.

<img width="204" height="288" alt="fueled_stove" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/820ddf2d-f508-4941-a77a-2af14243ca65" />

        To actually use the cooking pot, it needs to be placed on a campfire or other heat source block such as the stove.
        The stove is a heat source block that needs fuel to stay burning and is activated by using a flint and steel.

## Pottery Wheel
<img width="397" height="441" alt="clay_effigy_craft" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bebc7bc8-0e9a-4d44-88b8-bfc37bb6d2ff" />
<img width="248" height="284" alt="basic_pottery_wheel_screenshot" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c299588b-c048-41b4-b51a-a7f0fdbc1d1b" />

        Pottery wheels are used to shape clay into items such as bowls, vases, molds or sculptures that can be fired into ceramic form. 
        Players must first interact with the pottery wheel gui to choose what item they want to craft from a list of possible recipes.
        To start crafting, the pottery wheel must be kept spinning while players add clay lumps onto the wheel until the crafting is finished. 
        If the spinning stops, the craft fails.
<img width="201" height="154" alt="basic_pottery_wheel_screenshot_1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c2f2be3-5cf9-4158-afae-be1874d8226b" />
<img width="248" height="267" alt="basic_pottery_wheel" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98ee973b-454f-485a-9a2a-4a889519a24b" />

       The advanced pottery wheel allows for more complex recipes and is easier to keep spinning.
<img width="197" height="207" alt="advanced_pottery_wheel_screenshot" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08af2029-7a7b-4fbd-b4a4-acfed59e1aeb" />
<img width="248" height="267" alt="advanced_pottery_wheel" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dda6001a-7cf3-41a8-8945-49ae4317ca88" />

        Clay effigies are magical constructus that can be crafted at pottery wheels. 
        They can be used to spawn villagers or allow for player respawns as a replacement for beds.
<img width="117" height="278" alt="clay_effigy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c707a267-58d0-4c26-88a4-f20a60e41882" />

## Spinning Wheel
<img width="842" height="457" alt="spinning_wheel_scene" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea71901e-ba58-423d-9d40-67b432d04a9e" />
        
        The spinning wheel is a crafting station that allows for the creation of different clothes and fibers. 
        Sheep no longer give wool blocks when sheared and will instead give raw wool or fleece. Fleece then needs to be spun into wool.
        Other materials, such as hemp, flax or plant fibers can also be given spinning wheel recipes. 
<img width="213" height="260" alt="spinning_wheel_screenshot" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4476ada8-17f1-4f28-adea-84f9d6928110" />
<img width="248" height="280" alt="spinning_wheel" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bee55ba-98ec-4a49-b5a6-8779143c3a79" />


## Quern stone
<img width="622" height="367" alt="quern_stone_scene" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef35afbc-c292-4dca-8107-ebedd6a8b097" />

        The quern stone is a stone tool that is used for hand grinding different types of materials into powder or paste.
        The quern is used by first adding material by right clicking; the added material is displayed in the opening.

<img width="206" height="184" alt="quern_stone_display" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4962d38a-0eb1-4059-b77f-22cdcbccc2c2" />
<img width="237" height="244" alt="quern_stone" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64871cfd-79e8-47c3-8fb3-1a28f809afa0" />

        With an empty hand, holding right click on the quern will allow players to rotate the upper stone by moving their cursor in a circle.
        The ground up material is automatically deposited and extra material can be retrieved by shift right clicking.

## Mill stone
<img width="479" height="590" alt="millstone_scene" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fdb52a1-1369-4c83-b864-df3a628f5820" />

        The mill stone is a large stone tool that is used for automatically grinding or milling different types of materials into powder or paste.
        The mill stone is comprised of a stationary base called the bedstone and rotating top called the runner stone.
<img width="278" height="176" alt="millstone_bedstone" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6726b510-e841-4743-8021-68aeb6dfa5ce" />
<img width="248" height="176" alt="millstone_turnstone" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69b87e69-c84b-4859-bfa7-9689c69aa0b1" />

        When enough rotational force is applied to the mill stone's shaft, via either a water wheel or wind rotor, the mill stone will begin rotating.
        The raw material must be supplied through the opening at the top of the runner stone and the ground up material will be deposited around the bedstone.
<img width="370" height="302" alt="millstone_full" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21d0115b-5da4-4cdd-a87d-888f57f186d8" />
<img width="396" height="325" alt="millstone_turn" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e0d94ef-702a-44e8-873b-0750c9f7444c" />

## Water wheel
<img width="290" height="293" alt="water_wheel_01" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64fa686e-8a48-444e-993a-5206c438dee0" />

        The water wheel is the core component of a water mill; a structure that converts the kinetic energy of flowing water into rotational force. 
        To set up a water wheel, players must first place a gearbox and connect a shaft to it, then the water wheel is attached to the shaft.
<img width="296" height="359" alt="water_wheel_02" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/109c11a1-d70c-450b-bc95-cf9e47cfe791" />
<img width="330" height="396" alt="water_wheel" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c66050ca-4f5c-4ade-a7d1-c883fd0cc0ec" />
        
        When one side of the water wheel is touching flowing water, it will begin to rotate, providing rotational force to the connected gearbox.

## Wind rotor
<img width="339" height="429" alt="windmill_2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30dacbbd-3214-4719-a224-1485b3bc82bb" />

        The wind rotor is the core component of a wind mill; a structure that converts the kinetic energy of wind into rotational force. 
        To set up a wind rotor, players must first place a gearbox and connect a shaft to it, then four wind sails must be attached to the shaft.
<img width="365" height="475" alt="windmill_1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/562ca3b0-3786-494d-ad9c-4d6b3bd8e233" />
<img width="385" height="506" alt="windmill" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71e1130c-0e41-4b31-b3da-18526dda1012" />

        When all four wind sails are exposed to open air, the wind rotor will begin to rotate, providing rotational force to the connected gearbox.

## Totem of Undying
       *Note: This is a potential mod compatibility feature with the mod 'Extraordinary Extra Totems'
       (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/extraordinary-extra-totems)
<img width="662" height="411" alt="totem_of_undying_scene" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/444fd503-5f13-4cca-9ec2-f0ebf6e6b08f" />

       The Totem of Undying is a magical and religious artifact that has a few different functions:
       When held, the totem will function like normal and will save the player from death.
       When placed, the totem becomes a workstation for cleric villagers and acts as a respawn point for players.
