        The cooking pot is used to prepare different kinds of dishes with the risk of making dubious food or burnt food if one isn't careful. 
        All recipes are shapeless and players can either throw the ingredients into the pot or open it's gui by interacting with it.

        To actually use the cooking pot, it needs to be placed on a campfire or other heat source block such as the stove.
        The stove is a heat source block that needs fuel to stay burning and is activated by using a flint and steel.

## Pottery Wheel

        Pottery wheels are used to shape clay into items such as bowls, vases, molds or sculptures that can be fired into ceramic form. 
        Players must first interact with the pottery wheel gui to choose what item they want to craft from a list of possible recipes.
        To start crafting, the pottery wheel must be kept spinning while players add clay lumps onto the wheel until the crafting is finished. 
        If the spinning stops, the craft fails.

       The advanced pottery wheel allows for more complex recipes and is easier to keep spinning.

        Clay effigies are magical constructus that can be crafted at pottery wheels. 
        They can be used to spawn villagers or allow for player respawns as a replacement for beds.

## Spinning Wheel
<img width="842" height="457" alt="spinning_wheel_scene" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea71901e-ba58-423d-9d40-67b432d04a9e" />
        
        The spinning wheel is a crafting station that allows for the creation of different clothes and fibers. 
        Sheep no longer give wool blocks when sheared and will instead give raw wool or fleece. Fleece then needs to be spun into wool.
        Other materials, such as hemp, flax or plant fibers can also be given spinning wheel recipes.
