Primitive Progress

Primitive Progress is a Minecraft mod that overhauls the early- to mid-game crafting experience by introducing a wide range of interactive, survival-oriented workstations with a more primitive, tactile feel. Instead of relying on instant crafting grids or high-tech automation, this mod emphasizes manual effort, timing, and engagement in a more immersive survival progression.

        The cooking pot is used to cook different kinds of foods with the risk of making failed or burnt dishes if one isn't too careful. All recipes are shapeless and players can either throw the ingredients into the pot or open it by interacting with it.
